   about (Euros 1.894m) and the female customers made orders of about.
-  The Elderly made the highest sales of about (Euros 14.287m) followed by the Senior citizens which made about (Euros 4.907m). The Teenager had no sales in the category.

## Recommendation
There are no doubts that the Business is performing well as the major customers where are from Australia.
However, there is room for more improvements
-  The Teenager didn’t do any sales. Strategies to increase the sales should be made like High publicity, discounted selling on products
-  Use database to gather customers feedback to get their experiences about the product or services. This information can be used to identify areas for improvement.
